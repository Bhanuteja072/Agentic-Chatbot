#Weekly AI News Summary

<think>
Okay, let's start by understanding the user's query. They want me to summarize AI-related news articles into markdown format, following specific guidelines. The key points are to include the date in IST timezone, concise summaries sorted by date (latest first), and source URLs as links. 

First, I need to process each article provided. Each article has content, a URL, and a date. But the dates provided are in GMT, so I need to convert them to IST. Since IST is UTC+5:30, I'll add that to the GMT dates. For example, the first article's date is Mon, 29 Sep 2025 13:47:38 GMT. Adding 5.5 hours would make it 19:17:38 IST on the same day, so the date in IST is 2025-09-29.

Next, each summary should be concise. I'll need to extract the main AI-related points from each article. For instance, the first article talks about AI reshaping workplaces and job cuts in companies like TCS and Accenture. The summary should capture that without extra details.

Sorting is crucial. The user wants the latest articles first. So I'll list the articles from the most recent date to the oldest. The latest date among the provided articles is October 4, 2025, so that's the first entry. Then October 2, October 1, etc.

I need to check each URL to ensure it's correctly formatted as a markdown link. Also, verify that the dates are converted correctly and formatted as YYYY-MM-DD. For example, an article with date Tue, 30 Sep 2025 20:24:31 GMT becomes 2025-09-30 in IST since adding 5.5 hours would still be the same day.

Some articles might have irrelevant content mixed in. For example, one article mentions a car bomb in Quetta, but the relevant part is about AI in agriculture. I'll focus only on the AI-related parts.

I also need to make sure that each summary is a single line if possible, avoiding bullet points or multiple sentences unless necessary. However, the user's example shows summaries with hyphens, so maybe each summary is a bullet point under the date.

Wait, the user's example uses the format:

### [Date]
- [Summary](URL)

So each date has a heading with ### and the summaries are bullet points under each date. Also, the dates need to be sorted in descending order (latest first), each with their respective articles.

Let me go through each article one by one, convert the date to IST, summarize the AI-related content, and then arrange them in order.

Starting with the first article:

Date: Mon, 29 Sep 2025 13:47:38 GMT → IST is 29 Sep 2025 19:17:38 → date is 2025-09-29.

Summary: AI reshaping workplaces and job cuts at TCS, Accenture, and global tech giants.

Next article: Tue, 30 Sep 2025 20:24:31 GMT → IST 30 Sep 2025 01:54:31 → date 2025-09-30. Summary: AI-driven innovations boosting Indian crop yields by 20%, precision farming tools, digital market linkages.

Another article: Sat, 04 Oct 2025 11:51:41 GMT → IST 04 Oct 2025 17:21:41 → date 2025-10-04. Summary: AI misuse, legal issues, Pixel 10 launch, and global tech news.

Continue this process for all articles, ensuring dates are correct, summaries are concise, and URLs are linked properly.

Now, sorting all dates in descending order. The latest date is 2025-10-04, then 2025-10-02, 2025-10-01, etc.

I need to make sure there are no duplicate dates and that each entry is correctly placed. Also, check for any missing or duplicate articles. Once all entries are properly formatted and sorted, the final markdown should meet the user's requirements.
